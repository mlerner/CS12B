Date.java

The purpose of this program is to create my own implementation of the TeacherDate class.
The methods do the following: set the object's initial values, return values associated 
with the object, determine whether the year is a leap year, return the day of the week 
associated with the object, increment the day, returns a string representation of the date,
determine whether objects refer the same dates, set the amount of days in a month, 
and determine the amount of days since 1/1/1970.
