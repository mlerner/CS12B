Purpose: The purpose of this program is to create a line from two points and then calculate its slope. Additionally it determines whether the points are collinear. 
Function: This program can construct a line from two points and then calculate their slopes. It does this by first testing whether the x coordinates for the line's point are the same, and returns an error if so. Otherwise, it subtracts the y coordinates from each other and divides them by the difference between the x coordinates. To determine whether the points are collinear it uses the formula described here: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Collinear.html under theorem 2 and 3. If they are collinear, the method returns true, otherwise it returns false.
