This program is supposed to create bank accounts and then increment and decrement
based upon credit and debit operations. It creates a test account and then takes 
out $2000 followed by increasing by $4000. It then prints the balance. Then it 
increases by $1000 and decreases by $500 for 10 repetitions. It then prints the balance.
