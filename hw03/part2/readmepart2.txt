InsuredPackage.java

UsePackage.java

This program creates a package price assignment system. It does this by asking 
the user how the package will travel, and then calculating the price. If the 
user wants to create an insured package, the program calculates how much 
additional cost there should be based upon the specifications. It also prints
the regular package and the insured package.
