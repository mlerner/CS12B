This program was intended to create a ticket system.
It does this by creating an array of tickets, and will ask the user how many 
days in advance the ticket was bought if it was an advance ticket. It then 
calculates the price of the ticket. It places the tickets in an array, and then
calculates the worth of the tickets, as well as printing them.
